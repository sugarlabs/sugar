more than twenty-five languages, Sugarâ€™s Activities are used every

Hacking
-------

For hacking you can use the sugar-build tool. Sugar is made of several modules and it often depends on libraries that have not yet been packaged in GNU/Linux distributions. To make it easier for developers to build from sources, we developed a set of scripts that automates builds and other common development tasks.
