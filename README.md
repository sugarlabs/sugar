Sugar
=====

Sugar is the core component of a worldwide effort to provide every
child with an equal opportunity for a quality education. Available in
more than twenty-five languages, Sugar’s Activities are used every
school day by children in more than forty countries.

Originally developed for the One Laptop per Child XO-1 netbook, Sugar
runs on most computers. Sugar is free/libre and open-source software.

Hacking
-------

For hacking you can use the sugar-build tool. Sugar is made of several
modules and it often depends on libraries that have not yet been
packaged in GNU/Linux distributions. To make it easier for developers to
build from sources, we developed a set of scripts that automates builds
and other common development tasks.
