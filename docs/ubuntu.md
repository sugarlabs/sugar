Using Sugar on Ubuntu
=====================

*Ubuntu is a [Debian](debian.md)-based Linux operating system, with Gnome as its default desktop environment.* -- [wikipedia.org](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_%28operating_system%29)

In relation to Sugar, Ubuntu is a downstream distribution project that can be used to run Sugar.

Using Sugar inside another desktop environment on Ubuntu
--------------------------------------------------------

Sugar is a desktop environment. For developers who use Ubuntu Unity, Gnome or another desktop environment, Sugar can be run inside that environment as a window.

Install the Remote Desktop packages:

    sudo apt install xrdp rdesktop

Create a user for Sugar and set a default desktop environment:

    sudo adduser guest
    sudo su - guest -c 'echo sugar >> .xsession'

Start a session:

    rdesktop -g 1200x900 -u username -p password 0
