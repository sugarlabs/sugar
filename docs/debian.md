Using Sugar on Debian
=====================

*Debian is a free operating system (OS) for your computer. An operating system is the set of basic programs and utilities that make your computer run.* -- [debian.org](https://www.debian.org/)

In relation to Sugar, Debian is a downstream distribution project that can be used to run Sugar.

Using Sugar on Debian
---------------------

Sugar is available in Debian:

-   install Debian in the usual way, see [debian.org](https://www.debian.org/), and [debian-installer](https://www.debian.org/releases/stretch/debian-installer/),
-   when the install has completed, log in, install Sugar, a display manager, and reboot,

```
sudo apt install sucrose lightdm
exec sudo reboot
```

-   in the graphical login screen, [change from the default X session to Sugar](https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar-docs/blob/master/src/sugar-logging-in.md),
-   log in as the non-root user, which you will have created during install.

Known bugs include;

-   Sugar starts in Journal, workaround is to press F3 button, fixed by [Metacity 074af8f](https://github.com/GNOME/metacity/commit/074af8f87ef89b13ff326fb5d04ee424bbfd4ced),

Packaging
---------

Packaging of Sugar on Debian is done by a team:

-   [pkg-sugar-team project](https://salsa.debian.org/pkg-sugar-team),
-   [pkg-sugar-devel mailing list](https://lists.alioth.debian.org/mailman/listinfo/pkg-sugar-devel),
-   [pkg-sugar git repositories](https://salsa.debian.org/pkg-sugar-team/sugar)
-   [package archive of Jonas Smedegaard](http://debian.jones.dk/pkg/sugar_/),

Sucrose packages are usually updated in the unstable release. These packages migrate to the testing release after a while. You can see the current package versions [here](http://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=sugar&searchon=names&suite=all&section=all).
