Raspberry Pi are a series of small, low cost, low power computers.

Sugar can be run on a Raspberry Pi. Before getting started with Sugar on Raspberry Pi, make sure you have the following [prerequisites](https://github.com/sugarlabs/RPi-Docs/blob/main/src/prerequisite.md)

Raspberry Pi OS
---------------

Raspberry Pi OS is a derivative of Debian.  Sugar can be installed using [Instructions for Debian](debian.md), or can be installed using the Raspberry Pi OS below are the methods to install Sugar on Raspberry Pi OS.;

Setting up on Hardware
---------------


For setting up Sugar on Raspberry Pi for hardware devices, refer to the following guide:

- [Setting up on Hardware ](https://github.com/sugarlabs/RPi-Docs/blob/main/src/hardware.md)


Fedora Sugar on a Stick
-----------------------

Sugar on a Stick has many activities and regular security updates. See [Sugar on a Stick](https://github.com/sugarlabs/RPi-Docs/blob/main/src/rpi-soas.md) for how to download and install it. Sugar on a Stick is a spin of Fedora.

(Developers may focus on either Fedora or Debian when [setting up a development environment](development-environment.md) for Sugar on Raspberry Pi, because Sugar development on generic computers is focused on those operating systems.)

More Resources in "RPi-docs" Repository
-----------------------

Explore additional resources related to Raspberry Pi on Sugar in the dedicated [RPi-docs](https://github.com/sugarlabs/RPi-Docs) repository, access guides on activities, development, and community engagement for enhanced testing and optimization and for improving documentation.
